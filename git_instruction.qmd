This tutorial will provide instructions on setting up Git & Github and how how to integrate these into R/RStudio to use in a basic workflow. There are 4 steps in this tutorial:

1.  Download & install Git
2.  Create GitHub account
3.  Check if RStudio can find Git
4.  TEST - My first pull request

For this tutorial I have greatly simplified the nice free book [Happy Git and GitHub for the UseR](https://happygitwithr.com/) explaining how to setup and use Git & GitHub with `R`. For a more in depth explanation please consult this book.

## Download & Install Git

To use Git through RStudio you will need to download and install `git`. As most of our group members have Windows laptops provided by HSG IT department I will provide instructions for this setup. For macOS you will need to consult the previously mentioned [book](https://happygitwithr.com/), but good news for you it is actually a lot easier than using a Windows laptop. If you have any issue we can work through them at our in person tutorial.

First we are going to download Git for Windows [here](https://gitforwindows.org/). This will install `git` and `git bash`, which is a terminal to use git in the command line from windows. Selecting all the default installation instructions should be fine **EXCEPT** to make sure that when asked about `Adjusting your PATH environmen` make sure to select `Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software`.

Once `git` and `git bash`are installed open `git bash` either directly at the end of the installation or open it by using the `windows search`and typing `git bash` and then open the `git bash` app. It should look something like this:

You can also check that `git` has been properly downloaded by typing `git --version` into the terminal window, as shown in the screenshot. If you are using windows you should get the same output as presented.

We will be only using the terminal to set up you `git` credentials. This is done with the following 2 simple commands.

```{bash}
#| output: false
#| 
git config --global user.name "James Bond"
git config --global user.email "007@example.com"

```

The `user.name` should be your first and last name, `user.email` can be either your HSG or personal email. The email address you choose will need to be the same email address for your GitHub account in **Step 2**.

Now you have configured Git and are ready to create a GitHub account.

## Create GitHub Account

Create a free [GitHub Account](https://github.com). You will need to use the same email address as your `git config`.

To interact with the remote Git server, here Github, we need to create access credentials for such a request. This can be done via SSH or HTTPS. For ease of setup we are going to be using HTTPS, which will use a **personal access token (PAT)**. Once you have a GitHub account you can create a PAT by using this [LINK](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).

Add a `NOTE` for what this will be used for. I wrote `HSG_git_tutorial` that you can also use.

leave the expiration to 30 days and select the following scopes:

-   [ ] **repo**
-   [ ] **workflow**
-   [ ] **gist**
-   [ ] **user**

Then click generate token. This token will only be shown now so copy it into Notepad or another text editor and save it somewhere safe. We will now store this token explicitly so git can use it when accessing GitHub. For this we will use the `gitcreds` package in `R`.

```{R gitcreds}
#| eval: false
#| output: false
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()

```

Then input your token. Now it is saved and you can work with GitHub.

## Check if RStudio can find Git

Now lets check if RStudio can find git and use everything we setup.

First restart Rstudio and go to *Tools \> Global Options \> Git/SVN* and make sure that the box *Git executable* points to your Git executable.

This should look something like this under `Git executable`:

C:/Users/Sam.Vickery/AppData/Local/Programs/Git/bin/git.exe

Now we know that RStudio recognizes Git and we can create `projects` using Git and GitHub repositories. This is what we will be doing in the next section.

## TEST - My first pull request

**We will work through this in person on Wednesday**
